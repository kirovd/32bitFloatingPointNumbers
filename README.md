# 32bitFloatingPointNumbers

## Adding/Subtracting

The adding/subtracting was done on paper to make sure that the two 32 bit floating point numbers can be added/subtracted in binary. Firstly,
the two decimal numbers where converted to binary and then back to decimal numbers to double check the convertion. Secondly, using the both
numbers to add/subtract, the user gets the result in decimal; where the result was then converted to binary as the final answer. Thirdly, 
after making the calculations on paper, I then moved to the ATMEL program to create the 32 bit floating point numbers. Forthly, I had to do
exactly the same procedure that I did on paper to a computer program where the result will be shown on a 8 bit binary counter.

## Ports

The ports must be correctly written in the program and connected to the right ports in the 8 bit binary counter. Otherwise, there wont be a
result to your programs algorithm.

## Display

The 8 bit binary counter is one of the best hardware for reading/displaying the results of any algorithms that uses binary to either
add/subtract/multiply/divide and gets the result as binary.
